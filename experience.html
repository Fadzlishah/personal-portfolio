<p> I am really loves to playing futsal and it is a part of my life. I have represented my faculty, Islamic Banking (IBAC) in the futsal tournament Sukan Antara Fakulti (SAF) organized by UiTM Kota Bharu. In that tournament, my team and I managed to win it and be the champion. In futsal, it taught me a lot about patience, team spirit and leadership. When we win, we celebrate together as a team and vice versa when we lose, we also accept it as a team.
